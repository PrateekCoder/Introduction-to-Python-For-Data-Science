Python as a calculator
100xp
Python is perfectly suited to do basic calculations. Apart from addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, there is also support for more advanced operations such as:

Exponentiation: **. This operator raises the number to its left to the power of the number to its right: for example 4**2 will give 16.
Modulo: %. It returns the remainder of the division of the number to the left by the number on its right, for example 18 % 7 equals 4.

# Addition and subtraction
print(5 + 5)
print(5 - 5)

# Multiplication and division
print(3 * 5)
print(10 / 2)

# Exponentiation
print(4 ** 2)

# Modulo
print(18 % 7)

# How much is your $100 worth after 7 years?
print(100*(1.1**7))
