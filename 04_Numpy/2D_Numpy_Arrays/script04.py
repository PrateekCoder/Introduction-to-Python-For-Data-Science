2D Arithmetic
100xp
Remember how you calculated the Body Mass Index for all baseball players? Numpy was able to perform all calculations element-wise. For 2D Numpy arrays this isn't any different! You can combine matrices with single numbers, with vectors, and with other matrices.

Execute the code below in the IPython shell and see if you understand:

import numpy as np
np_mat = np.array([[1, 2],
                   [3, 4],
                   [5, 6]])
np_mat * 2
np_mat + np.array([10, 10])
np_mat + np_mat
np_baseball is coded for you; it's again a 2D Numpy array with 3 columns representing height, weight and age.
'''

# baseball is available as a regular list of lists
# update is available as 2D Numpy array

# Import numpy package
import numpy as np

# Create np_baseball (3 cols)
np_baseball = np.array(baseball)

# Print out addition of np_baseball and update
print(np_baseball+update)

# Create Numpy array: conversion
conversion = np.array([0.0254, 0.453592, 1])

# Print out product of np_baseball and conversion
print(np_baseball*conversion)
